# Music Genre Classification

Music Experts have been trying for a long time to understand sound and what differenciates one song from another. How to visualize sound. What makes a tone different from another. This data hopefully can give the opportunity to do just that.

In this Project we will use the GTZAN Dataset which has a Raw data of 1.2GB and consists of 1000 audio files(.au) divided into 10 folders for 10 genres equally. I.e Every genre has 100 audio files. Different genres are: blues, classical, country, disco, hip-hop, jazz, metal, pop, reggae, and rock. Each audio file is in the WAV format and has a sampling rate of 22,050 Hz and a bit depth of 16 bits.
